Chronology of commands for Directory_Creator_Day1.
I first made a root director, 
then created notebook, README, and LICENSE files in it. 
I then put in text into the notebook and README files. 
Then I created Data, Results, and Doc directories. 
Each contain a README.md file. Each README.md file has info about what type of information is contained in each.
