Chronology of commands for Directory_Creator_Day1.
I first made a root director, 
then created notebook, README, and LICENSE files in it. 
I then put in text into the notebook and README files. 
Then I created Data, Results, and Doc directories. 
Each contain a README.md file. Each README.md file has info about what type of information is contained in each.

Option 1 for this project: compare environmental data from the one sensor that is attached to the CO2 sensor. THis will give me one set of temp, RH, and CO2 measurements per time sample.

Option 2: I compare that sensor with others in different locations to compare how Temp and RH are different in location, and make mathematical relationships between CO2 in other places based on the math. relationship between temp and RH in different locations.
